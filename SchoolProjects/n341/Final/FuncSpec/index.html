<h1>One World Market - Functional Spec</h1>
<h2>Objective</h2>
	<div>
		<p>	One World Market is a Japanese grocery store that currently 
		does not have its own website. This will be an attempt to design 
		a website designed around customer needs, accessibility, and 
		ease of use. The site will provide information on the types of 
		products available. The goal is to increase revenue by improving
		new and returning customer interactions with the busines.</p>
		<p>The success of the site will be measured by daily page views. 
		Holiday periods will gain more and cause inflated 
		results, but the average page view per month can be recorded and 
		a trend can be drawn from the data. </p>
	</div>
<h2>Needs Analysis</h2>
	<div>
		<p>The site will do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Provide hours of operation
				</li>
				<li>
					Showcase the products available
				</li>
				<li>
					Display the menu
				</li>
				<li>
					Provide directions to the store
				</li>
				<li>
					Have a form to send special offers and information
				</li>
				<li>
					Inform on holiday openings/closings of the business
				</li>
				<li>
					Have content in both japanese and english where possible
				</li>
				<li>
					Provide contact information
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This information should be easily accessible and visually stand 
			out. It should also display the quality of the service and its 
			products, while not being cluttered by information and photos. It 
			should cater equally and adapt to the needs of both the Japanese 
			and American communities in terms of the information provided.</p>
	</div>
<h2>Audience Characteristics</h2>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>
				New Customers
			</li>
			<li>
				Returning Customers
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Although the two groups can also be divided into two subgroups
		(American and Japanese), their purposes for visiting/researching 
		the site will generally be the same: times, location, products, 
		and news. New customers will be looking more for the latter two 
		(times and location), while returning customers may focus more on
		the products (menu and items) and specific events/holidays.</p>
		<p>The site will be geared towards pc users, but should support 
		mobile users as well. There are few japanese stores within the 
		Indianapolis, and some people come from far away just to shop at 
		this place. Having mobile support should make it easier to look 
		up information during travel. </p>
	<h3>Primary Audience</h3>
		<p>Primarily, the site will be geared towards japanese adults who
		will make use of the grocery portion of the store. While there 
		are obviously more americans in the area, the vast majority are 
		returning japanese customers who want access to their native 
		products. Many products that are "necessary" in order to make 
		traditional, every-day japanese food, and the store offers 
		various brand options that other international stores do not 
		have. These are people that will be looking for a genuine, 
		focused shopping experience, not an off-brand isle of scattered
		asian products in an international supermarket. </p>
		<p>The site should show the availability of such products, as 
		well as inform the returning customer of any holiday(s) 
		that would lead to scheduled closings or hour changes. There 
		should be an option (ideally auto-detect) to switch the content 
		to japanese for ease-of-access.</p>
	<h3>Secondary Audience</h3>
		<p>The remaining audience will be americans of all ages. This is
		due to the fact that there is a wide variety of products 
		available.Children would be interested in Japanese candy, while adults may just be looking for 
		healthier alternatives, or simply acquired a taste for japanese 
		cuisine.</p>
		<p>It will be necessary to display representative products as 
		photos for these customers, as they may have little to no prior 
		knowledge of what the grocery has to offer.</p>
